            <div class="content">
            <strong>1</strong> In the beginning God created the heaven and the Earth.<br><br>
            <strong>2</strong> And the Earth was without form, and void; and darkness<br> was upon the face of the deep.<br>
                               And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.<br><br>
            <strong>3</strong> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.<br><br>
            <strong>4</strong> And God saw the light taht is was good: and God <br>divided the light from the darkness<br><br>
            <strong>5</strong> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he <br>called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.<br><br>
            <strong>6</strong> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, <br> and let it divide the waters from the waters.<br><br>
            <strong>7</strong>  And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were <br>under the firmament from the waters which were <br>above the firmament: and it was so.<br><br>
            <strong>8</strong>  And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening <br>and the morning were the second day.<br><br>
            <strong>9</strong>  And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered <br>together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.<br><br>
            <strong>10</strong>  And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: <br>and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
            <strong>11</strong>  And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree<br> yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.<br><br>
            <strong>12</strong> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, <br>and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
            <strong>13</strong> And the evening and the morning were the third day.<br><br>
            <strong>14</strong>  And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; <br>and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:<br><br>
            <strong>15</strong> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give <br>light upon the earth: and it was so.<br><br>
            <strong>16</strong>  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,<br> and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.<br><br>
            <strong>17</strong>  And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,<br><br>
            <strong>18</strong> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the <br>light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
            <strong>19</strong>  And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.<br><br>
            <strong>20</strong> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, <br>and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.<br><br>
            <strong>21</strong> And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,<br> which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, <br>and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
            <strong>22</strong> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the <br> waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.<br><br>
            <strong>23</strong> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.<br><br>
            <strong>24</strong>  And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, <br>cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.<br><br>
            <strong>25</strong> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every<br> thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.<br><br>
            <strong>26</strong> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: <br>and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, <br>and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.<br><br>
            <strong>27</strong> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God <br>created he him; male and female created he them.<br><br>
            <strong>28</strong>  And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, <br>and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, <br>and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.<br><br>
            <strong>29</strong> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, <br>which is upon the face of all the earth,<br> and every tree, <br>in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.<br><br>
            <strong>30</strong> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, <br>and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, <br>I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.<br><br>
            <strong>31</strong> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, <br>it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.<br><br>
